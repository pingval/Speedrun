Thanks for really looking into the details and suggesting rule improvement. I was just communicating with bjw about that.
my announcement draft: https://github.com/pingval/Speedrun/blob/master/TH09/announcement.md
my findings: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XMAfTkl0RqTohn09S2ppcZZ6abk_7Ryct9tvjMpeAc4/edit?usp=sharing

In response to your point, I think the rules should be changed to this:
Easy~Lunatic: "Timing starts at shot type select and ends when Eiki/Reimu take their last hit. Replays allowed, 1cc only, default lives (Player), default health. "In-game time" is a placeholder for replay time"
No Restrictions: "Timing starts at shot type select and ends when Eiki/Reimu take their last hit. Video required, multiple credits allowed, nondefault lives (Player), nondefault health allowed"

I think "lives" should be left, because the other Touhou Series rules describe "Player" as "lives". (e.g. PCB: "Timing starts at shot type select and ends when Resurrection Butterfly times out. Replays allowed, 1cc only, default lives")

Also, although not related to the default "Player", I think the following text should be added, to reflect the contents of this thread: https://www.speedrun.com/touhou_kaeitzuka_phantasmagoria_of_flower_view/thread/7u0mo
"For adjustment, Real time is replay time + 20s." (grammar might be weird)

How about my proposal for improving the rules?
